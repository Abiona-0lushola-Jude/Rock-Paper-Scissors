**Tech used:** 

HTML,CSS, JAVASCRIPT
I created the desktop version first and added css for styling. The project was inspired by frontendmentor.I made created divs for the logo container and the game container. I located each icon at it absolute position and toggle the result and the game by clicking on the "PLAY AGAIN" button.I created an array in my script that check for the last image source picked my the gamer and compare it to the array created to picked image sources for the house. The rules is below and can be viewed and every answer or result of the gamer is stored in a temporary local storage and can be viewed beside the logo.

**Lesson Learned:**

This project has really helped me to understand javascript array methods, and i have been able to use it with my object method knowledge. It has also help me develop the skill of Googling.
